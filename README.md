## Features

üöÄ **Highly Accurate Emulation**: HexaMIPS provides an accurate emulation environment for a subset of the MIPS architecture, ensuring your code runs as expected.

üîß **Flexible Input**: Accepts 32-bit hexadecimal instructions from various sources, making it easy to test your MIPS programs.

üìú **Instruction Set Support**: HexaMIPS supports a range of MIPS instructions, including ADD, SUB, AND, OR, SLT, MUL, BEQ, BNE, ADDI, SLTI, ANDI, ORI, and LUI.

üí° **Clear Output**: HexaMIPS generates clear and informative output, making it easy to understand the results of your MIPS code.

üéâ **Syscall Support**: Handle syscalls gracefully with HexaMIPS, ensuring your programs can interact with the operating system.

## Getting Started

To get started with HexaMIPS, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hexamips.git
   ```
2. Compile the code using your preferred C compiler.

   ```shell
   gcc hexamips.c -o hexamips
   ```

3. Run HexaMIPS with a MIPS instruction file.

   ```shell
   ./hexamips input.hex
   ```
4. Explore the generated output and register values after execution.

## Example

Here's a quick example of using HexaMIPS:

```MIPS
$ ./hexamips example.hex

Program
  0: add  $3, $0, $0
  1: addi $4, $0, 10
  2: beq  $3, $4, 7
  3: add  $2, $3, $4
  4: sub  $5, $4, $3
  5: slt  $6, $2, $3
  6: and  $7, $2, $4
  7: or   $8, $2, $5

Output
10
Registers After Execution
$2  = 10
$3  = 0
$4  = 10
$5  = 10
$6  = 0
$7  = 0
$8  = 10
```
